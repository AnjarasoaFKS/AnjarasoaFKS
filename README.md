- 👀 I’m interested in learning predominantly front-end web development.

- 📫 How to reach me: fenoa38@gmail.com // ig: misfitbaconry

I am more than willing to jump on collaboration opportunities that allows me to practice the basics, for now, HTML + CSS.
I am unemployed so if there is an entry-level opportunity, let me know. Thanks!
